Vamonos is a library for generating browser-based visualizations of algorithms
& data structures. Here are some reasons why we think Vamonos is great:

    No installation barrier. Visualizations run on any modern browser using
    standard Javascript. No plugins or extensions are needed.

    Self-containment. Visualizations do not require any server-side
    interaction.  Your browser doesn’t even have to be connected to the
    internet.  Visualizations can even be “compiled” into a self-contained HTML
    file that can be easily distributed to students.

    Interaction. Students can easily provide their own inputs to an algorithm,
    set breakpoints & watchpoints, and step backwards & forwards through the
    algorithm’s execution.

    Extensibility. If you can implement an algorithm in Javascript, then you
    can easily make a Vamonos visualization for that algorithm. We currently
    support dynamic display of array and graph data structures.

    Appearance. Our default visualization styles are beautiful and natively
    scalable using your browser’s zoom feature. Of course, if you are handy
    with CSS, you can also easily style a visualization to meet your needs.

Vamonos is developed in the EECS department of Oregon State University. It was
started while the project leader was in the Computer Science department at the
University of Montana. The name “Vamonos” doesn’t really have to be an
acronym, but if it were, its expansion would be Visualizing Algorithms from
Montana and Oregon State.

Vamonos is developed with support from NSF award #1149647. Any opinions,
findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are
