#+TITLE: GraphDisplay D3 refactor notes

* Graph Display:
** vertex attributes tooltips
** some kind of transition for vertices appearing and disappearing and moving
** add self-loops for nfa to regex

* Graph Editing
** selection
   nodes shouldn't be selected and unselected by dragging them

* unneeded things currently out of scope
** setup continuations waiting for jsPlumb to load
