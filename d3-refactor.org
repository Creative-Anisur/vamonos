#+TITLE: GraphDisplay D3 refactor notes

* Graph Display:

** vertex attributes tooltips
** drop shadows
   find a way to get better colors
   maybe use a tint or something

** some kind of transition for vertices appearing and disappearing and moving

** fit graph shouldn't change minx and miny - or maybe dragging should change it

* Graph Editing

** selection
   nodes shouldn't be selected by dragging them - fix later

** creating new vertices
   when one is selected already, it gets an automatic edge

** more visual feedback - highlight vertices and edges on mouseover

** editable edge attributes

** dragging - update TheGraph
   it should be harder to create new vertices accidentally

* unneeded things currently out of scope
** setup continuations waiting for jsPlumb to load

* notes
** jQuery used for @$outer, d3 for @inner

* check when done

** dijkstra-quiz highlighting the correct vertex
