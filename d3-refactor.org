#+TITLE: GraphDisplay D3 refactor notes

* Graph Display:

** directed edges - label positions - perhaps use textPath

** styleEdges - merge condition and callback

** vertex attributes tooltips

** optionally remember modified vertex positions in display mode

** force layout

* Graph Editing

** editable edge attributes

** dragging - update TheGraph

** selection

* unneeded things currently out of scope
** setup continuations waiting for jsPlumb to load

* notes
** jQuery used for @$outer, d3 for @inner

* check when done

** dijkstra-quiz highlighting the correct vertex
