#+TITLE: GraphDisplay D3 refactor notes

* Graph Display:
** vertex attributes tooltips
** drop shadows
   find a way to get better colors
   maybe use a tint or something
** some kind of transition for vertices appearing and disappearing and moving
** fit graph shouldn't change minx and miny - or maybe dragging should change it
** add self-loops for nfa to regex

* Graph Editing
** editable edge attributes
** selection
   nodes shouldn't be selected and unselected by dragging them

* unneeded things currently out of scope
** setup continuations waiting for jsPlumb to load

* notes
** jQuery used for @$outer, d3 for @inner

* check when done
** dijkstra-quiz highlighting the correct vertex
