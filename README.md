Vamonos
=======

Vamonos is a library for generating browser-based visualizations of
algorithms & data structures. Here are some reasons why we think Vamonos is great:

* *No installation barrier.* Visualizations run on any modern
    browser using standard Javascript and CSS. No plugins or extensions
    are needed.

* *Self-containment.* Visualizations do not require any
    server-side interaction. It is not even necessary to be connected to
    the internet. Visualizations can even be "compiled" into a single,
    standalone HTML file.

* *Extensibility.* If you can implement an algorithm in Javascript,
    then you can easily write a visualization for that algorithm.

* *Style.* Our default visualization styles are beautiful and scalable.
    Of course, if you are handy with CSS, you can also easily style a
    visualization to meet your needs.
